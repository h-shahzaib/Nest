# Nest â€” Fluent Structured Text Generation for Code & Scripts

**Nest** is a C# library designed to simplify the generation of structured text â€” particularly code and scripting content â€” through a fluent, builder-style API. It is especially well-suited for automation scenarios where manual string formatting, indentation, and structural consistency become repetitive or error-prone.

Nest aims to be the go-to solution for code and script generation, with a focus on being **minimal**, **zero-dependency**, and **highly composable**.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- ðŸ”§ Fluent API for structured text generation
- ðŸ§± Core focus on indentation and formatting
- ðŸ“¦ Modular packages for each target language
- âš¡ Zero dependencies, lightweight and minimal
- ðŸ’¬ Ideal for code generators, scaffolding tools, and scripting utilities

## ðŸ“¦ Packages

**Nest** aspires to be a suite of language-specific packages, each containing built-in formatting conventions and behaviors tailored to the respective language.

**Available:**

`Nest.CSharp` â€“ Generate C# code effortlessly

- Nuget: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nest.CSharp
- GitHub: https://github.com/h-shahzaib/Nest/tree/master/Nest.CSharp

**Coming Soon:**

- `Nest.Yaml` â€“ YAML generation with proper indentation and spacing

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

At the core of **Nest** lies a simple idea: _structured text should be composable and language-aware, without forcing developers to manage indentation, line breaks, or braces manually._

Nest automatically handles:

- Indentation depth and alignment
- Block formatting (open/close structure)
- Optional line breaks and spacing
- Language-specific structure semantics

## ðŸ§± Core Constructs

The library revolves around two primary constructs that serve as the foundation for composing structured text:

### `.B(...)` â€” **Block**

Represents a block of text, typically used for grouping lines with indentation and optional padding (line breaks) before and after.

The behavior & usage of `.B()` is language-specific. In C#, for instance, it automatically wraps the content with braces and applies indentation according to C# conventions.

### `.L(...)` â€” **Line(s)**

Adds one or more lines of text. Accepts a `params string[]` input.

- **No parameters**: Inserts a blank line
- **One line**: Adds a single line
- **Multiple lines**: Adds all lines, with appropriate line breaks before and/or after

## ðŸ’¡ Use Case Examples

With just `.L()` and `.B()`, Nest makes it easy to generate structured output in any code or scripting language. You focus on the logic; Nest takes care of the layout.

Stay tuned as support for more languages like YAML, JSON, Bash, and more is on the way.

## ðŸš§ Under Active Development

Nest is currently in active development. While stable for basic use, the API and behavior may evolve as support for more languages and features is added.
